# About ScottCodiN
### ScottCodiN IDE, made by Foundation Scott, is a free and easy to use IDE for progamming. It currently supports Python, C#, Ruby, C++, Lua, and Luau.

# How to set my programming language?
### ScottCodiN IDE, or ScottCodiN, does not automatically set what language you are programming in. To set your language you simply need to first put said languages comment tag and then '--++KEYHERE++--'. The IDE picks up on what language is inserted in the tags and sets that as your programming language. For example you can do '# --++Python++--' for Python.

# Yeah, but what are the keys?
### Each supported programming language and its keys are as follows:

#### Python: 'Python'

#### C#: 'Csharp'

#### Ruby: 'Ruby'

#### C++: 'cpp'

#### Lua: 'Lua'

#### Luau: 'Luau'
